# IMDB-Clone

A mini IMDB clone app in which we can search movies based on OMDB API, 
with search suggestions. Clicking on a particular movie card opens 
a new movie page for more info. On clicking on the favourite button, 
we can add a movie to the favourite list which is using local storage to store movies.
